# How to use it. 
For the installation of these package you must execute in a terminal window:

2) Include precompiled-abis package.

        const precompiled = require('@rsksmart/rsk-precompiled-abis');

3) Create an instance of the contract using package build method and Web3 as a parameter. 

    (i.e.: using Bridge)

        var bridge = precompiled.bridge.build(new Web3('http://localhost:4444'));
